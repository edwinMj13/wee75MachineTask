# Stock Tracker App
Built in Flutter

This Flutter application allows users to search for company stock prices, view current and previous day prices, and maintain a watchlist. Users can add companies to their watchlist, view real-time price comparisons, and remove entries from the list as desired.

## Features

- **Search for Company Stocks**: Users can search for stock prices by entering company names or keywords.
- **Real-Time Price Comparison**: Displays the company's latest stock price, highlighting green if the price is higher than the previous day and red if it is lower.
- **Watchlist Management**: Users can add a companyâ€™s stock to a watchlist stored in a local Hive database for quick access.
- **Delete from Watchlist**: Users can delete entries from the watchlist, removing them from the local database.
